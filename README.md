# kelpie-hub

A hub that lets you follow and steer [kelpie](https://github.com/gronare/kelpie) from your phone. Each machine running kelpie dials out to the hub; your devices read every machine's board, get notified when a task needs you, and answer questions, approve pushes or start tasks.

The hub is a mailbox, never a party. Everything it carries is end-to-end encrypted between a machine and the devices that machine has paired with, and every command is signed by a device the machine trusts. The hub sees who talks to whom and when, not what is said, and it cannot start anything on a machine.

This repository currently holds the protocol: the `kelpie-hub-protocol` crate and the test vectors that other implementations are checked against. The server and the web app build on it.

## The protocol

- **Envelope.** A plaintext header (`v`, `id`, `kind`, `from`, `machine`, `at`, `exp`, `schema`, `kc`, and for notices `urgency` and `collapse`), one key row per recipient, the ciphertext and a signature. Each kind has a maximum lifetime (commands 24 hours, notices 1 day, results 7 days, boards 30 days); a header with a longer one is refused.
- **Content.** AES-256-GCM with a fresh 32-byte key and 96-bit nonce per envelope; the header's canonical bytes are the associated data. `kc` is SHA-256 of the content key, so a recipient handed a different key detects it before decrypting.
- **Key rows.** The content key is sealed to each recipient device or machine with HPKE (RFC 9180) base mode, `DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256)`, `HKDF-SHA256`, `AES-128-GCM`, with the header bytes as associated data. A row copied under another recipient's id does not open, because it is sealed to the first recipient's key.
- **Signature.** Ed25519 over the header bytes followed by the ciphertext. Key rows are outside it, so the hub can hand each device only its own row.
- **Commands.** `authorize` drops, without any reply, anything that fails before the signature is verified: wrong version or shape, not a command, another machine, an unknown device, a bad signature. A validly signed command whose id the machine already applied for that device gets the stored result again, even once it has expired. Otherwise the machine applies it only if it is unexpired, from a device with the `control` role, of a kind the machine accepts and well formed, and answers a refusal with a reason the device can show.

The message types (board snapshot, notice, answer, push approval, start task, run routine, result, alert) are in `crates/kelpie-hub-protocol/src`. A board carries only allow-listed fields: no local paths, hostnames, pane ids or terminal titles.

## Pairing

Pairing a device with a machine binds both parties' keys without trusting the hub that relays them. The device commits before it learns anything from the machine, so the hub cannot try substitute keys until the two codes match.

1. The device draws a 32-byte nonce `n_d` (from `crypto.getRandomValues`; `pairingNonce()` in `js/protocol.js`) and sends `commitment = SHA-256("kelpie-pair-commit-v1" || D || n_d || code)`, where `D` is its signing key followed by its encryption key and `code` is the one-time code from the hub.
2. The machine draws a fresh 32-byte nonce `n_m` and replies with its keys `M` and `n_m`.
3. The device reveals `D` and `n_d`. The machine refuses the pairing if they do not hash, together with the code the machine holds, to the commitment, so a machine holding a different code fails here before any digits are shown.
4. Both sides show `SHA-256("kelpie-pair-v1" || M || D || n_m || n_d || code)` as six digits. The user confirms that the digits match before the machine adds the device to its trusted list.

The flow holds only if each side takes one chance per attempt:

- One pairing invocation (`kelpie hub pair` on the machine, "Pair" in the app) accepts exactly one commitment.
- A commitment mismatch, a second commitment or a timeout ends the invocation with a visible failure. The user starts again; nothing retries quietly.
- The device shows every attempt, including failed ones, so an attempt the user did not start is visible.

A hub that swaps keys has to fix its substitutes before it sees `n_d`, so it matches the codes only by a one-in-a-million guess. `DevicePairing` and `MachinePairing` in the crate, and `pairingCommitment` and `machineComparisonCode` in `js/protocol.js`, carry the two sides.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test
node --test
```

`cargo test` checks the crate and replays `vectors/*.json`. `node --test` (Node 25 or newer) checks the same vectors with WebCrypto as browsers expose it, plus [`@hpke/core`](https://github.com/dajiaji/hpke-js) for HPKE: it opens what Rust sealed with non-extractable keys, reseals it byte for byte, refuses every tampered, expired, misaddressed or malformed case with the same error as Rust, and runs the pairing flows. Run `npm install` once first.

The vectors are generated from fixed keys and randomness:

```sh
cargo run -p kelpie-hub-protocol --features test-vectors --bin vectors
```
